# DAOists

DAOists are the caretakers of the server! They have multiple roles, each with their own unique blend of values, principles, skills and ideas. Different people are here for different reasons. Some are here for neutrality or to balance discussions, some to provide guidance whether it be technical or spiritual motivation, some to spread their knowledge and educate others, some to build things they believe in and support their vision for the future, some to connect everyone in DOTSAMA and so on.

The key is that DAOists represent the members of their class with the most integrity, skill or whatever else that is valuable about them. Most importantly they are trustworthy in terms of their loyalty to the DAO and generally tempered enough that in a tough situation they would always do their best to minimize risk to the DAO and its members.

However since we are all humans and nobody is perfect, there will be many mistakes along the way that eventually will help us learn from them and drive us even further. DAOists want genuinely to see the DAO prosper and have strong enough conviction in that desire to not let it waver easily in the face of adversity.
